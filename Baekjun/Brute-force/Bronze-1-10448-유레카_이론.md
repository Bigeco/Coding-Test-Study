# My Solution
## 1. Approach
I defined two functions based on their role. Function T corresponds to triangular numbers, and 'is_tri_sum' is a function that check whether the sum of up to three triangular numbers is equal to the given value 'num'. Using the 'break' statement doesn't allow you to exit the nested for loop at once. To address this, I utilized the 'return' statement in the function, enabling an exit at once. Since the function T value is guaranteed to be smaller than the given 'num', I added triangular numbers to the 'arr' until 'arr[-1]' is smaller.

## 2. Code
```python
def T(n):
    return n*(n+1)/2

def is_tri_sum(len, arr, num):
    for i in range(len):
        for j in range(len):
            for k in range(len):
                if arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] == num:
                    return 1
    return 0

n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    num = int(input())
    cnt, arr = 2, [T(1)]
    while arr[-1] < num:
        arr.append(T(cnt))
        cnt += 1
    len_arr = len(arr)
    print(is_tri_sum(len_arr, arr, num))
```

## 3. Self-feedback
Every time I receive an input, I keep generating the 'arr' containing triangular numbers, which is inefficient. The reason is that the values of triangular numbers do not change. Therefore, to write efficient code, I believe it is necessary to create a separate list of triangular numbers in advance.
